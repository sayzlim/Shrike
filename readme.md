![](shrike-preview.jpg "Shrike Safari Extension for Twitter")

Shrike is a Safari extension that removes clutter from Twitter. You won’t be able to see the followers and following count from your own and other people so you start seeing people as they are — not from their online reputation.

We should earn back the sanity and not become biased from the mere number of followers count. We can do better than that.
